# This is a lab 9

For the last homework exercise, **easy way for it** you can run **SortingTest.java** in **src/algorithm/test** and write down runtime of each algorithm of sorting.

By the way you have to change the number of field **MAX** in **SortingTest** class from 10000 to 30000, 50000, 70000, and 100000 and record the time of each algorithm again.

Good luck for you all!
